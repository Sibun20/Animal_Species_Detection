# Animal_Species_Detection 
Description 

The project aims to develop a deep learning based system capable of classifying animals and 
predicting its species. The system will leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a 
powerful type of deep learning architecture designed for image processing tasks. Below is an 
in-depth breakdown of the development process. 

Dataset 

This dataset consist of 28000 images approximately which are high variety and of 10 classes 
like butterfly, cat, chicken, cow, dog, elephant, horse, sheep, spider and squirrel. These 
dataset are basically use for the classification problem of animal species. The link of the 
dataset is given below:
